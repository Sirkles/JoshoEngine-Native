JoshoEngine
===========

A 2D Game Engine written in C++ and uses OpenGL. This is a complete rewrite of my XNA/C# game engine of the same name.

The code name for the engine is "wow such engine". :)

## Features
* Robust C++ API that is really simple
* Highly abstracted from low-level functionaly, so it's really cross-platform.
* Lots of geometric functionality like 2D Vectors, Rectangles and Circles.
* Pretty well documented.

## Roadmap
* Add support for Android and iOS.
* Add support PlayStation 4. (I already have a development license)
* Add more geometry functionality like rectangle rotation and polygons.
* Add basic physics.
